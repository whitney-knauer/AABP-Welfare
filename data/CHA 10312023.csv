I do believe group housing has the ability to allow us to intensively feed calves more effectively and I believe has advantages socially (both real and those perceived by the public).

However for a disease prevention standpoint I don't believe this is a good idea.

Some have tried pair housing for the social benefit.,The biggest challenge with group housing seems to be that it can magnify disease pressure. We tend to see more Mycoplasma in socially housed calves along with increased risk of diarrhea. Well managed dairies don't seem to have a problem - but when the risk goes up on some farms - it gets magnified by group housing. With pair housing - calves cross sucking each other has been a major problem. For some reason - this seems to be worse with pair housing as compared to small groups.,"1) Improved weight gain
 2) Improved perception of calf welfare by both employees and those that visit the farm","They need to first understand that group housing (and some type of automatic feeding system) is not going to be a reason to cut labor devoted to the calves. Some producers feel like ""we can get rid of the calf crew now."" Social housing almost always fails in these scenarios. Just because you aren't filling buckets/bottles doesn't mean you don't still have a crew devoted to cleaning, treating calves, recognizing disease, etc. The better the farm management and day 1 calf care (maternity, colostrum) - the more successful social housing will be.
 
 For pair housing - we need to figure out how to reduce the cross sucking whether by providing other social enrichment or some barrier to the mammary gland (ie. spray on bra or something)",,,2-Somewhat feasible,Yes,"Pairs,Large groups (>8 calves/group),Cow-calf pairs","In general more disease - especially in cow-calf pairs and large groups. Most of these farms ""that switched"" saw a dramatic increase in scours and sometimes pneumonia. The farms that tried pair housing and went back to single housing almost always state ""cross sucking"" as the major reason.","Usually health does improve - however we are often delaying disease until post-weaning and in many cases this ""band aids"" the farm from actually fixing the main issue (for example - maybe they failed with group housing because of marginal colostrum management - by going back to individual housing - they continue to live with having marginal colostrum management).
 
 The other challenge is that average daily gains will reduce as these farms go back to feeding twice a day.",In many cases health does improve at least in the pre-weaning period. Mortality often decreases as well. In some cases the farm will devote more employees to the calf program since they perceive their main job to be filling buckets and bottles with milk.,4-Large Groups (20-25 calves),,I do think there are significant benefits to social housing (especially in small groups). I think we will trend this way because it allows an easier way to feed calves multiple times per day and has social benefits (both real and perceived). I would like to answer the question above with small group housing because I think that is much better disease wise than large groups. However as dairies get bigger - they want to move to larger groups. So my answer to the above question is not what I THINK should be the most common housing in 20 years - but where I see the industry moving).,GeoffreyWilson.Smith@zoetis.com
